# A Toolkit for Travel Time Estimation

## Descriptions

We start this project due to the following reasons:

- There currently no well-designed toolkit for travel time estimation which contains a whole pipeline for data preprocessing, map matching and visualization.

- We are currently in need of this kind of toolkit to support our academic research.

And if the development process goes well, we will consider to release this toolkit for open source use.

## Attention

This repo is currently under active development and thus is not friendly for open source use. More documentations will be released for some months.

## Important Dependencies

### FMM - a map matching library

We are currently using this fork of the original repository for better Python3 support. (i.e. https://github.com/temetski/fmm/tree/python3_fixes)
